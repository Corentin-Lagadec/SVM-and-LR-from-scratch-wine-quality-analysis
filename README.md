# SVM-and-LR-from-scratch-wine-quality-analysis
The goal of this project is to implement two classic binary classification algorithms — Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) — entirely from scratch. We will work with the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and the task is to predict whether a wine is "good" (quality ≥ 6) or "bad" (quality &lt; 6)

# You will find 4 files:
- metrics: which simply allows you to evaluate the performance of a model using appropriate measures such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
- project: which includes Data Exploration and Preprocessing, as well as Evaluation and Analysis of the different models
- Algo.ipynb: which includes our 2 classes of SVM and Logistic Regression algorithms with the mathematical description of the two models.
- Algo.py : version python of Algo.ipynb
