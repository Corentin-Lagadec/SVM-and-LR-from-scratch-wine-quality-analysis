# SVM-and-LR-from-scratch-wine-quality-analysis
The goal of this project is to implement two classic binary classification algorithms — Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) — entirely from scratch. We will work with the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and the task is to predict whether a wine is "good" (quality ≥ 6) or "bad" (quality &lt; 6)
